Ecco i passaggi da seguire:\n\n### Opzione 1: Build con EAS (Consigliato - pi\u00f9 semplice)\n\n**Passaggi:**\n\n1. **Installa EAS CLI** (se non l'hai gi\u00e0 fatto):\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g eas-cli\n   ```\n\n2. **Login a Expo**:\n   ```bash\n   eas login\n   ```\n\n3. **Configura il progetto**:\n   ```bash\n   eas build:configure\n   ```\n\n4. **Crea l'APK**:\n   ```bash\n   eas build -p android --profile preview\n   ```\n   \n   Oppure per una build di produzione:\n   ```bash\n   eas build -p android --profile production\n   ```\n\n5. **Scarica l'APK**: Una volta completata la build (riceverai un'email), potrai scaricare l'APK dal link fornito o dalla dashboard di Expo.\n\n### Opzione 2: Build Locale\n\n**Passaggi:**\n\n1. **Installa Android Studio** e configura l'ambiente Android SDK\n\n2. **Genera i file nativi**:\n   ```bash\n   npx expo prebuild -p android\n   ```\n\n3. **Vai nella cartella android**:\n   ```bash\n   cd android\n   ```\n\n4. **Crea l'APK**:\n   ```bash\n   ./gradlew assembleRelease\n   ```\n\n5. **Trova l'APK**: L'APK sar\u00e0 in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Note Importanti:\n\n- **File Audio Mancanti**: Prima di creare l'APK, assicurati di avere i file audio nella cartella `assets/sounds/`. L'app attualmente cerca questi file:\n  - rain.mp3, rain2.mp3\n  - sea.mp3, sea2.mp3\n  - fire.mp3, fire2.mp3\n  - wind.mp3, wind2.mp3\n  - waterfall.mp3, waterfall2.mp3\n  - crickets.mp3, crickets2.mp3\n  - cicadas.mp3, cicadas2.mp3\n\n- **Firma dell'APK**: Per distribuire l'app su Google Play Store, dovrai firmare l'APK. EAS gestisce questo automaticamente.\n\n- **Dimensione dell'APK**: Con i file audio, l'APK potrebbe essere grande. Considera di usare formati compressi come .mp3 a bitrate pi\u00f9 basso.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Caratteristiche dell'App Configurate:\n\n- \u2705 Riproduzione audio in background\n- \u2705 Funziona con schermo bloccato\n- \u2705 Modalit\u00e0 chiara e scura\n- \u2705 7 canali audio con fader\n- \u2705 Cambio loop toccando l'icona\n- \u2705 Permessi Android per servizi in foreground\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 Prossimi Passi Consigliati:\n\n1. Aggiungi i file audio mancanti\n2. Testa l'app su un dispositivo fisico\n3. Crea l'APK con EAS\n4. Installa e testa l'APK sul tuo dispositivo\n\nVuoi che ti aiuti con qualcos'altro per l'app prima di creare l'APK?"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "8fc7fbf73495914f55fcb08f051fbaecb4d3134d", "message": "Partial commit (cancelled)", "timestamp": "2025-10-29T16:23:20Z", "files_changed": ["eas.json", "app.json"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "fc5337ab088160ca15cdc18ad8c78dc3d8a350d0"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-29T16:20:14Z"}]
