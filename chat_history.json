The fader position will control the volume of the corresponding sound.\n3.  **Integrate the relaxing sounds:** Find or create audio files for each of the specified sounds (rain, sea, fire, wind, waterfall, crickets, and frogs). Integrate these sounds into the app and connect them to their respective faders.\n4.  **Add a play/pause button:** Implement a play/pause button that controls the overall playback of the mixed sounds.\n5.  **Design the user interface:** Style the mixer interface with the specified colors and typography to create a visually appealing and relaxing experience.\n6.  **Modify the app/(tabs) folder:** Implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-29T15:44:09.663109"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll create a relaxation app with a mixer-style interface featuring 5 channels with faders for volume control.
